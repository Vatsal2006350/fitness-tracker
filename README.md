# Fitness Freak Platform

Fitness Freak is a comprehensive fitness initiative inspired by a personal weight-loss journey, where I transformed my life by losing 65 kilograms. Initially focused on sharing home workout videos on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fitness Freak has now evolved into a robust wellness platform that reaches over 15,000 individuals.
